# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository will be documented in this file.

Changelog tracking begins with the next release. Historical releases are not backfilled.

The versions documented here should match the published plugin versions in the affected manifest files.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-23

### omni-analytics

**Changed**
- Replaced env-var auth setup (`export OMNI_BASE_URL` / `export OMNI_API_TOKEN`) with CLI profile workflow (`omni config show` → `omni config use`) across all skills, README, AGENTS.md, and rules
- Added `-o` / `--format` flag guidance to all skills for controlling JSON vs human-readable output

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-22

### omni-analytics

**Fixed**
- Corrected CLI flag names across all skills to match actual `omni` CLI flags — the CLI is inconsistent with hyphenation per subcommand, so each flag was verified individually
- `--branchid` (no hyphen): `models validate`, `models yaml-get`
- `--branch-id` (with hyphen): `models refresh`, `models get-topic`, `models content-validator-get`, `ai generate-query`
- `--filename`, `--sortfield`, `--creatorid`, `--userid`, `--jobids` (all no hyphen)
- `--clear-existing-draft` requires a string value (e.g. `true`), not a bare flag

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-21

### omni-analytics

**Fixed**
- Removed invalid `views: <view_name>:` wrapper from content builder `yaml-create` example — the API rejects it with `saveError: "Invalid property name at \"views\""`. The YAML body must start directly at `dimensions:` / `measures:`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-21

### omni-analytics

**Added**
- Eval framework for all 9 Omni skills (`evals/` directory with runner, scorer, and per-skill `evals.json`)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-21

### omni-integrations
